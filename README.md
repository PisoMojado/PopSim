# PopSim
###A simulation to demonstrate the emergence of a most recent common ancestor in a given population group.

A simple simulation of ancestry in randomized populations, with random mating patterns. This project serves two purposes:
- To demonstrate through trials the tendency for populations to share a common ancestor after n-generations
- To refresh myself on my C++
